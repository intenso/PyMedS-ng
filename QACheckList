1 - Possible error in errRequest, changed ign to failure, hard to reproduce.
    Need to handle other NotImplemented err backs.
2 - hangs when opening large files.  Need to switch to threads and a deferred.
3 - No render to test video
4 - PS3 cannot stream audio.

Did not have access to a Windows box for testing the Intel tools.
Did not have an ISO handy for testing the dvd module.  Anyways the DVD module
  is incomplete and would have had failures.
I did not have time to test the disappearing media server, but am possitive
  I fixed it w/ changes to rebroadcast my announcements before the previous
  one timed out.
